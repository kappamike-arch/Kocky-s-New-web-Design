KOCKY'S STAGING SITE - BROWSER TEST URLs
==========================================

Copy and paste these URLs into your browser to test the fixes:

MAIN SITE:
http://staging.kockys.com/
- Should show the main Kocky's Bar & Grill website

ADMIN PANEL (FIXED - NO MORE REDIRECTS):
http://staging.kockys.com/admin
- Should load the admin panel directly
- Should show login form or dashboard (depending on auth status)
- NO MORE redirect to /dashboard!

DASHBOARD REDIRECT (FIXED):
http://staging.kockys.com/dashboard
- Should automatically redirect to /admin
- Should show "Redirecting to admin panel..." message briefly

API ENDPOINTS:
http://staging.kockys.com/api/
- Should show API welcome message

BACKEND HEALTH:
http://127.0.0.1:5001/health
- Should show backend health status (if accessing from server)

==========================================
EXPECTED RESULTS:
- All URLs should return HTTP 200 (no 404 errors)
- /admin should load directly without redirects
- /dashboard should redirect to /admin smoothly
- No more redirect loops or 404 errors
- Static assets (CSS/JS) should load properly

==========================================
If you see any issues, the fixes may need to be applied or services restarted.
