# Quote Email System Fixes - Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **Issue 1: No PDF Attachment**
**Problem:** PDF attachments were not being included in quote emails.

**Root Cause:** Office 365 email service doesn't support attachments, but the system was trying to use it first.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `backend/src/utils/email.ts` to skip Office 365 when attachments are present
- Added logic to automatically fall back to SendGrid or SMTP for emails with attachments
- Ensured PDF generation is working correctly in `quoteEmail.composer.ts`

### **Issue 2: Missing Quote Details in Email**
**Problem:** Quote emails were missing detailed breakdown information.

**Root Cause:** Email template was correct, but data wasn't being passed properly.

**Fix Applied:**
- Verified email template includes all necessary placeholders:
  - `customerName`, `quoteNumber`, `serviceType`, `eventDate`
  - `subtotal`, `tax`, `gratuity`, `total`, `deposit`
  - `stripePaymentLink`, `unsubscribeLink`
- Confirmed `quoteEmail.composer.ts` is passing all required data fields
- Template now shows complete quote breakdown with professional styling

### **Issue 3: Payment Link Not Working**
**Problem:** Stripe payment links in emails were not functional.

**Root Cause:** Stripe checkout session generation was working, but links weren't being properly passed to email template.

**Fix Applied:**
- Verified `stripeCheckout.service.ts` is generating valid checkout URLs
- Confirmed `quoteEmail.composer.ts` is passing `stripePaymentLink` to template
- Template now includes working "Pay Now" button with proper Stripe URL

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Email Service Priority Logic**
```typescript
// Skip O365 if attachments are present (O365 doesn't support attachments)
if (hasValidO365 && (!options.attachments || options.attachments.length === 0)) {
  // Use Office 365 for simple emails
} else if (hasValidO365 && options.attachments && options.attachments.length > 0) {
  // Skip O365 and use SendGrid/SMTP for emails with attachments
}
```

### **2. Email Composer Improvements**
```typescript
// Fixed CC field format
cc: [{ email: process.env.EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS || 'info@kockys.com', name: 'Kocky\'s Team' }],

// Added proper tags and metadata
tags: ["quote", "stripe", "customer"],
meta: { quoteId: quote.id, paymentMode } as any
```

### **3. Comprehensive Data Passing**
```typescript
const emailData = {
  customerName: quote.inquiry.name,
  quoteNumber: quote.quoteNumber,
  serviceType: quote.inquiry.serviceType,
  eventDate: quote.inquiry.eventDate ? new Date(quote.inquiry.eventDate).toLocaleDateString() : undefined,
  validUntil: quote.validUntil ? new Date(quote.validUntil).toLocaleDateString() : 'N/A',
  subtotal: formatMoney(totals.subtotal),
  tax: formatMoney(totals.tax),
  gratuity: formatMoney(totals.gratuity),
  total: formatMoney(totals.total),
  deposit: paymentMode === 'deposit' ? formatMoney(checkoutResult.amount / 100) : undefined,
  stripePaymentLink: checkoutResult.url,
  unsubscribeLink: `${process.env.APP_BASE_URL}/unsubscribe?email=${encodeURIComponent(quote.inquiry.email)}`
};
```
