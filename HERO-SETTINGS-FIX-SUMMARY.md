## Current Data Status

Your **Brunch Page** currently has:
- Logo: `/uploads/logos/logo-brunch-1756543247360-105278658.png` (Butta Brunch logo)
- Title: Weekend Brunch
- Subtitle: BUTTA BRUNCH
- Description: 1st Session 11am-1pm 2nd Session 2pm-4pm Session
- Use Logo: Enabled âœ…

## How to Verify Everything is Working

1. **Check Admin Panel:**
   - Go to http://localhost:4000/hero-settings
   - You should see all your pages listed
   - The Brunch page should show the yellow Butta Brunch logo in preview
   - Try clicking "Save All Pages" - it should show success

2. **Check Frontend:**
   - Visit http://72.167.227.205:3003//brunch
   - **Important:** Do a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
   - The page should display the Butta Brunch logo

3. **Test an Update:**
   - In admin panel, change the subtitle for Brunch
   - Click "Save Page" or "Save All Pages"
   - Hard refresh the frontend
   - Changes should appear

## If Changes Still Don't Appear on Frontend

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   ```bash
   # In Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete
   # Select "Cached images and files"
   # Clear data
   ```

2. **Restart Frontend:**
   ```bash
   # Kill the frontend process
   killall -9 node
   
   # Start fresh
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Console:**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Look for any errors in the Console tab
   - Check Network tab to see if logo is loading

## Files That Were Modified

1. **Backend:**
   - `/backend/src/routes/hero-settings.routes.ts` - Added batch endpoint and improved upload handling
   - File size limit increased to 10MB

2. **Admin Panel:**
   - `/admin-panel/src/app/hero-settings/page.tsx` - Improved error handling and validation
   - Added detailed error logging

3. **Database:**
   - All hero settings are properly stored
   - Logo paths are correctly saved

## Next Steps

The system is now working correctly on the backend. If the frontend is still not showing updates:

1. Ensure the frontend server is running on port 3003
2. Clear all browser caches
3. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Verify the logo file is being served (check Network tab in browser DevTools)

The backend and admin panel are fully functional. Any remaining issues are likely related to browser caching or the frontend needing a full restart.
